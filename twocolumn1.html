											<h2>Tower of Betryal</h2>
											<h3>For those who break a sacred bond</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Since you are here you must have betrayed someone close to you or important in your life. As you walk in you notice Kizan, the ruler of this tower, 
											and he pulls you towards him with a flick of his finger. He then says a number, which correlates to what you have betrayed. You are the liquidfied 
											as your body slowly seeps through the ground toward your destination. 
										</p>
										<p>
											<h2> Floor 1</h2>
											On the first floor, we have people whose betrayals have only effected groups or 
											people to a very minimal degree. For example, an employee stealing money from their boss. 
											On this floor you will constantly feel nauseous and it continually smells of mold. Your 
											skin will burn and itch as though you have fiberglass stuck to your skin. They also 
											become enslaved to demons that take the form of whoever was betrayed.
										</p>
										<p>
										<h2> Floor 2</h2>
										<p>
											The Second Floor belongs to those who have betrayed their family or friends. These people who have trampled on this sacred bond are punished to a very high degree. Kizan is present on this floor to decide how and when punishments change. Kizan places them in a dream-like state where he can control what the people see and feel. They experience their loved ones killed repeatedly in the worst ways imaginable, from physical torture to forcing the victim to murder them. Once Kizan feels as though he has broken the person, he will move on to the next part. Kizan then creates gashes on the person and then covers them in maggot. Finally, after he decides that he is finished with this method, he straps the person to a chair, injects them with a substance that makes them more sensitive to pain, and proceeds to break/cut off their fingers and toes. While they do this, he makes them count down from 1000 to ensure they are conscious of the pain.
										</p>
										<p>
										<h2> The Wicked(Floor 3)</h2>
										<p>
											The wretched third-floor house is the worse people in hell, the home of those whose betrayals are too extreme for the earlier floor or those who have betrayed their romantic partner. Kizan is here, but so is Satan. Just the sight of him makes everyone go insane. He watches over the victims here for pure enjoyment. Both are in charge of the punishment on this floor. Most of the Victims experience the same things as the second floor, but these dreams are made to reflect what that person fears most, making it so much worse. Anything is done to break these people, for they have done the worst thing possible.

											<li>Known for his insane powers, Kizan has word magic, anything said will happen. This was gifted to him from Satan, and
												he is the second strongest being in hell; that is the reason he resides over the tower that is the deepest in hell. Kizan can also split himself so he can be in multiple places at once.
