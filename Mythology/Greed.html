											<h2>Tower of Greed</h2>
											<h3>For those who are to greedy</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Since you are here, you must have been too greedy, which has affected someone in your life. As you walk in, you notice Heldeshi, 
											the ruler of this tower, and she tries to give you an offer for mercy; you can take this offer if you would like. 
											If you do not, she will extend the offer to you throughout your stay here. Your body then explodes into pieces and comes back together at your destination.
										</p>
										<p>
											<h2>Floor 1</h2>
											On the first floor, we have people who gave into simple showings of greed. For example, an person stealing money from a business. On this you are constantly hungry and your sight is partially taken 
											from them as they run around the desert trying to avoid quicksand and giant centipedes.
											
				
										<p>
										<h2> Floor 2</h2>
										<p>
											This floor is saved for the extremely greedy; these can range from rapists, serial killers, etc.
											(Also among these people are those who cheated on their partner without intent to. The punishment is to 
											experience their loved ones having their sin done to them repeatedly in the worst ways imaginable. 
											In addition, they might be forced to be the ones doing the sin on them/ or have it done to themselves.

											<li>Known for her "mercy", Heldeshi is the keep of this tower. Satan has granted her with the able to grant "mercy" to anyone she deems worthy. When granted this "mercy"
											the victim then become a being that is no-longer human, and these beings feel extreme agony, and is turned into a slave to anyone Heldeshi decides. Heldeshi makes sure 
											these things are experiencing a worse time than those in the tower. Heldeshi is responsible for the husks you see on your way to your tower.
